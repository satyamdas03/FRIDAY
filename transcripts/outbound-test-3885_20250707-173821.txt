ASSISTANT: It seems like there might be some confusion with "CCS8 lambda services." Could you provide a bit more context or clarify what you're referring to? Are you looking for details about AWS Lambda or a specific service related to it?
USER: No, I want to get the information on lambda only.
USER: Whether it is serverless or not.
ASSISTANT: AWS Lambda is indeed a serverless compute service. It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale it with high availability. 

Got any other questions about AWS Lambda or serverless computing?
USER: No, thank you.
