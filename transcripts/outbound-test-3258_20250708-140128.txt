USER: I also need new instances to be created on that server.
ASSISTANT: Got it… You need new instances created on your server. We can definitely help with that. Are you looking to automate the provisioning of these instances, or do you have specific requirements in mind for these new instances?
USER: No, I want to create it using Terraform.
ASSISTANT: Absolutely, Terraform is a great choice for provisioning AWS resources. Here's a simple example of how you can create an EC2 instance using Terraform:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # This is a placeholder;
