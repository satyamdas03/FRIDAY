ASSISTANT: I know you're Shovraj Mukherjee, and it seems like you're dealing with challenges related to high AWS costs, project delivery delays, and customer support inefficiencies. If there's anything more specific you'd like to share or focus on, feel free to let me know!
USER: Okay, so do you help me? Can you help me?
USER: On deploying any solution using Terraform?
ASSISTANT: Absolutely, Shovraj! Terraform is a fantastic tool for infrastructure as code, and I can definitely guide you through deploying solutions on AWS using it. 

To get started, you'll need to:

1. **Install Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine.
   
2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials, usually in `~/.aws/credentials`.

3. **Write a Terraform Configuration**: Create a `.tf` file with the resource definitions. For example, to create an EC2 instance:

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

4. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
USER: Can you, can you speak in English?
ASSISTANT: Sure thing, I'll stick to English. So, as I was saying, Terraform is great for deploying infrastructure on AWS. If you need help with a specific Terraform setup
USER: Apni solutions pe please bangle nahi.
ASSISTANT: Bilkul, Shovraj! Main aapko Terraform ke madhyam se AWS par solutions deploy karne mein madad kar sakta hoon. 

Aapko kya karna hoga:

1. **Terraform Install Karein**: Apne system par Terraform install karein.

2. **AWS Credentials Configure
USER: What are you going to do?
