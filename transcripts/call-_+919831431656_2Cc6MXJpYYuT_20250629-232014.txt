ASSISTANT: Hello, I’m Friday from Workmates Core2Cloud—may I have your name and email to get started?
USER: My name is Satyam Das. My email is satyamdas0@gmail.com.
ASSISTANT: Great to meet you, Satyam Das! I'll make a note of your email: s.a.t.y.a.m.d.a.s.0 at gmail dot com. 

What cloud challenges are top-of-mind for you right now?
USER: Yeah, so my company is running a high IO workload on a storage optimizing pen, but is unsure if it's cost effective.
USER: So I would like to know how you would identify whether the instance type is over provisioned and
USER: I would like you to recommend a more appropriate instance for a strong .
USER: What is your opinion?
ASSISTANT: Gotcha, Satyam. Well, to determine if your instance type is over-provisioned, we can start by analyzing a few key metrics:

1. **CPU Utilization**: Check if the CPU usage is consistently low. If it's below 40% most of the time, you might be over-provisioned.

2. **Memory Utilization**: Similarly, if the memory usage is low, it could indicate that you're not using the full capacity.

3. **Network and Disk IO**: Since you mentioned high IO workloads, monitor the network and disk IO metrics. If they are high, but CPU and memory are low, you might need a different instance type that offers better IO performance.

4. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Use AWS CloudWatch to gather detailed metrics over time to see the trends.

### Recommendations:
- **General Purpose Instances**: If your workload varies,
USER: Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine.
USER: Can you send me an email to

USER: No, thank you, that is all.
ASSISTANT: Alright, thank you, Satyam! If
